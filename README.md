# face-impression-detection
This project trains a custom deep learning model for facial expression detection using a dataset of labeled facial images. The model classifies emotions like happy, sad, angry, neutral, and more.
🚀 Features
Trains a custom CNN model from scratch.
Supports custom datasets with images structured in labeled directories.
Uses PyTorch and Torchvision for model training.
Supports GPU acceleration for faster training.
Saves the trained model for real-world predictions.
